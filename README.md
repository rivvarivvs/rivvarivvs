### riva's here! ðŸ‘‹ who am i?

I'm an retired History student turned into a **backend web developer**, by the *magical ways of self-teaching*. 

### what is there to know about me? ðŸ“š 
  
Early in my life I developed my passion for computers and mathematical problems. Soon I left them to dedicate myself into the ways of analysing our society. It was in the last year that I decided to leave behind my school curriculum: it was then time to see if I was still as *in love with the world of computers*.

Through the next 9 months, I developed not only code and apps but also my **love for learning an for the world of web development**.
