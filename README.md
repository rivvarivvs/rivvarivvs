### hi there 👋 riva's here!

I'm an retired History student turned into a **backend web developer**, by the *magical ways of self-teaching*. 
  
Early in my life I developed my passion for computers and mathematical problems. Soon I left them to dedicate myself into the ways of analysing our society. It was in the last year that I decided to leave behind my school curriculum: it was then time to see if I was still as in love with the world of computers.

Through the next 9 months, I developed not only code and apps but also my **love for learning an for the world of web development**.
