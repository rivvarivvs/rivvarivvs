## riva's here! 👋 who am i?

i'm a retired history student turned into a **backend web developer**, by the *magical ways of self-teaching*.


## what is there to know about me? 📚

early in my life, i developed my passion for computers and mathematical problems. soon i left them to dedicate myself to the ways of analyzing our society. it was in the last year that i decided to leave behind my school curriculum: it was then time to see if i was still as in love *with the computer world*.
through the next 9 months, I developed not only code and apps but also my love for ***learning and the world of web development***.

## what have i done? ✨
