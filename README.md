## riva's here! 👋 who am i?

i'm an retired history student turned into a **backend web developer**, by the *magical ways of self-teaching*. 

## what is there to know about me? 📚 
  
early in my life i developed my passion for computers and mathematical problems. soon i left them to dedicate myself into the ways of analysing our society. it was in the last year that i decided to leave behind my school curriculum: it was then time to see if i was still as *in love with the computer world*.

through the next 9 months, I developed not only code and apps but also my ***love for learning an for the world of web development***.
